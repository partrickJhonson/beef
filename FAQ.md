### Metasploit integration does not work !

Be sure to read again the [[documentation|Metasploit]] (and [[here|Configuration]] also), and take care especially of the following points :
* Metasploit extension should be enabled in the overall config.yml file
* Host, callback_host and password should be correctly set in the extensions/metasploit/config.yml
* Metasploit should be launched correctly with msgrpc loaded

### What is the default login for BeEF?
