## How to help to improve this documentation ?

This documentation have been firstly reorganized and completed by [Nibbler](https://github.com/Nbblrr) based on the documentation and blog articles made by the whole community. This documentation is not perfect and it would be great for us to have any feedback on it or proposition of improvement.

If you have any idea, please send us an email with your criticisms, ideas, feedbacks or proposition. If you want to complete a page still empty, please send us the draft with potential screenshot, we will manage the format and include in the wiki.

Again, this wiki aims at gathering every feedback from BeEF users. So even a short email to say : "This module does not work on this browser whether it should" is a good feedback for us !
