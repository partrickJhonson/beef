## How can I help improve this wiki?
You are Welcome to make an issue with the Wiki information and say that you want it added to the wiki and then when it is reviewed, a maintainer will add it to Wiki once its verified.

If you have any idea, please send us an email with your criticisms, ideas, feedbacks or proposition. If you want to complete a page still empty, please send us the draft with potential screenshot, we will manage the format and include in the wiki.

Again, this wiki aims at gathering every feedback from BeEF users. So even a short email to say : "This module does not work on this browser whether it should" is a good feedback for us !
