This module will retrieve Geo-location information based on the neighboring wireless access points using commands encapsulated within a signed Java Applet. The user will be prompted to run the Java applet.

The details will include:
* GPS Coordinates details
* Street Address details

If the victim machine has a firewall that monitors outgoing connections (Zonealaram, LittleSnitch, etc), calls to Google maps will be alerted.
