## Introduction
Testing is important in every serious software development process. Although in BeEF we don't use TDD (Test-driven development), we do have a testing suite. 

BeEF tests are all contained inside `<beef_root>/test` directory.
A Rakefile, `<beef_root>/Rakefile`, contains testing tasks, organized by categories.

To run all tests, run (from `<beef_root>`):

`bundle exec rake all`

Otherwise, to run only some testing categories, for instance 'integration', run:

`bundle exec rake integration`

Before running the tests locally on your machine, you must install necessary gems:

```
export BEEF_TEST=1
bundle install
```

Before running the tests locally on your machine, you may want to change in `<beef_root>/test/common/test_constants.rb` the values of ATTACK_DOMAIN and VICTIM_DOMAIN, to something like:
```ruby
ATTACK_DOMAIN = "127.0.0.1"
VICTIM_DOMAIN = "localhost"
```
These values must differ however it is acceptable if both resolve to the same host.

On our continuous integration server, responsible to run all the tests suite on every GIT change, these constants already contain the proper default values. When you change these values for your local tests, be sure to don't commit/push these changes to the BeEF repository.

## Testing categories
The BeEF testing framework is a mix of 2 types of tests:
 - unit tests
 - functional tests

We currently have the following testing categories:
 - **integration**: mainly functional tests. We use Capybara and WebDriver in order to instrument the browser to do stuff for us. When running these tests, you will see a browser being open (currently Firefox, we're working on extending the testing suite including all the other browser). The integration testing suite is responsible to run functional tests on the Web GUI and test module execution.

 - **unit**: as the word says, mainly unit tests. Things like the directory structure, default config options and basic components like the network_handler are tested here.
 
 - **thirdparty/msf**: contains Metasploit related test files. With these tests Metasploit is started, connectivity and authentication to Metasploit's msgrpc is tested.

 - **thirdparty/bundle_audit**: updates Ruby Gems vulnerability database and checks gems for vulnerabilities using bundle-audit.

You will also notice another directory, **common**. As the name suggests, it contains things shared across testing suites, for instance constants and methods.

## Unit tests
When writing unit tests, you will mainly use two functions:

assert(Boolean) -> test pass if the Boolean condition is true.
For example:

```ruby
a = 1
b = 1
```
Test OK.
```ruby
assert(a == b)
# you can also use
assert_equal a,b
```
Test FAIL.
```ruby
assert(not(a == b))
```
To check if a code block hasn't raised (or throwned, as you prefer :-) any exception:
```ruby
assert_nothing_raised do
    something
end
```
## Functional tests

For functional tests, other than using some aspects of the unit tests, we use Capybara and Selenium-WebDriver. The result is the possibility to programmatically control a browser (at the moment Firefox, we're working to improve our testing suite with Webkit and other browsers) from a user's point-of-view. For instance, we're able to instrument the browser to login into the BeEF Web GUI, as you can see here below:
```ruby
  def self.login(session = nil)
    session = Capybara::Session.new(:selenium) if session.nil?
    session.visit(ATTACK_URL)
    sleep 2.0
    session.has_content?('BeEF Authentication')
    session.fill_in 'user', :with => 'beef'
    session.fill_in 'pass', :with => 'beef'
    session.click_button('Login')
    sleep 10.0

    session
  end
```
### Testing command modules
In order to inject custom JavaScript into the hooked browser during testing, you have 2 choices:
 - **execute_script** : available from objects of type Capybara::Session. It comes handy when the JavaScript you want to inject is actually returning something. Example:
```javascript
def test_jools_simple
        victim = BeefTest.new_victim
        script = " var ciccio = 'ciccio';
            ciccio += '_pasticcio';
            return ciccio;"
       result = victim.execute_script(script)
       assert_equal result,'ciccio_pasticcio'
    end
```
 - **RESTful API** : as you can launch command modules, and retrieve results through the RESTful API, you can use it also for testing purposes. This is particularly effective when the JavaScript to be injected in the hooked browser is complex or it's not explicitly returning a value (i.e.: returning data using only beef.net.send()). For example, to test the execution of a module (in this case a Debug module),see the following example. Also, have a look at `<beef_root>/test/integration/tc_debug_modules.rb` in order to see how some variables like `hb_session`, `token` and others are retrieved from previous tests.

```ruby
## Test debug module "Test_return_long_string" using the RESTful API
  def test_return_long_string
    repeat_string = "BeEF"
    repeat_count = 20

    response = RestClient.post "#{RESTAPI_MODULES}/#{@@hb_session}/#{@@mod_debug_long_string}?token=#{@@token}",
                               { 'repeat_string' => repeat_string,
                                 'repeat'        => repeat_count}.to_json,
                               :content_type => :json,
                               :accept => :json
    assert_equal 200, response.code
    assert_not_nil response.body
    result = JSON.parse(response.body)
    success = result['success']
    assert success

    cmd_id = result['command_id']
    count = 0
    response = RestClient.get "#{RESTAPI_MODULES}/#{@@hb_session}/#{@@mod_debug_long_string}/#{cmd_id}?token=#{@@token}"

    while(response.body.size <= 2 && count < 10)
      response = RestClient.get "#{RESTAPI_MODULES}/#{@@hb_session}/#{@@mod_debug_long_string}/#{cmd_id}?token=#{@@token}"
      sleep 2
      count += 1
    end
    assert_equal 200, response.code
    assert_not_nil response.body
    result = JSON.parse(response.body)
    data = JSON.parse(result['0']['data'])['data']
    assert_not_nil data
    assert_equal data,(repeat_string * repeat_count)
  end
```

### Testing Metasploit

To test Metasploit integration, run:
`bundle exec rake msf`

This will clone the latest version of Metasploit to /tmp/msf-test/

### Check Ruby Gems

To check Ruby Gems for known vulnerabilities, run:
`bundle exec rake bundle_audit`

## Conclusion
We are actively working to improve the BeEF testing suite, exploring also TeamCity and other testing solutions with Virtual Machines. We'll do our best to keep this page updated. For any trouble, do not hesitate to contact us via email/twitter.
