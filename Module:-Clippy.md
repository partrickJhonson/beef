* **Authors**: vt, denden
* **Browsers**: ALL
* [Code](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/tree/master/modules/social_engineering/clippy)

## Internal Working

Even if [the code](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/blob/master/modules/social_engineering/clippy/command.js) is a bit long, clippy only uses default javascript features. It first shows clippy with an helper text and wait for user interaction.

## Feedbacks

* Works perfectly on Chrome 23 but it requires access to Internet with default parameters (may be a problem on a internal network)
