##  What is BeEF?

BeEF is short for The **Browser Exploitation Framework**. It is a penetration testing tool that focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the web browser.

Amid growing concerns about web-borne attacks against both web and mobile clients, BeEF allows penetration testers to assess the actual security posture of a target environment by using client-side attack vectors. Unlike other security frameworks, BeEF looks past the hardened network perimeter and client system, and examines exploitability within the context of the one open door: the web browser. BeEF will hook one or more web browsers and use them to launch directed command modules and further attacks against the system from within the browser context.
