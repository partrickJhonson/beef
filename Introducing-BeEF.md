##  What is BeEF?

BeEF is short for **Browser Exploitation Framework**. It is an open source penetration testing tool focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in the web browser.

As an open source project, BeEF relies on a community of developers to maintain and improve the project. If you're interested in contributing to the BeEF project, there is a whole section in the wiki dedicated to developer knowledge to help get you started! [IV - Development](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki/ActiveRecord)

BeEF started in 2006 as a Ruby project, developed by a team led by Wade Alcorn. Amid growing concerns about web-borne attacks against both web and mobile clients, BeEF allows penetration testers to assess the security posture of a target environment by using client-side attack vectors. Unlike other security frameworks, BeEF looks past the hardened network perimeter and client system, and examines exploitability within the context of the one open door: the web browser. BeEF will hook one or more web browsers and use them to launch directed command modules and further attacks against the system from within the browser context.
